**Prosopographic analysis of the protocols of the meetings of the conference of the Imperial Academy of Sciences (1725 - 1743)**


Biographies describe life stories of particular people of significance, with the aim of getting a better understanding of their personality and actions, e.g., to understand their motives [Roberts, 2002]. In contrast, the focus of prosopography is to study life histories of groups of people in order to find out some kind of commonness or average in them [Verbovenet al., 2007].

A major problem faced by historians is the relative paucity of source material and the consequent danger of over-interpretation that arises from generalization and the 'case-study' approach.
Prosopography can help to overcome this problem: "By subjecting a … large number of members from a predefined population to the same questionnaire, the particular characteristics of that population as a whole become visible".
[Verbovenet al., 2007, p.36].
Central to prosopography are the concepts of individuals and groups - or networks. At its heart stands the idea of identity.

Establishing identity through names
Individuals are identified by their names. Every person in every society has a name. Although the form of the name will differ from society to society, names are themselves a cultural constant.
Names are more than mere labels. They have two primary functions, to distinguish one person from another, and to categorize, for example to assign a person to a particular family or clan. The name form can contain a wealth of additional information about sex, status, ethnicity, occupation and place.
Name data are the single most important type of information that we have and so a great deal of emphasis is placed on them here. What we know about these names is what someone else, a record-keeper somewhere in the past, has chosen to tell us. He (or she) may not give a name at all, but simply refer to a person as 'a man' or ' the priest'. Even this can be important because it will tell us something about that man’s status or role in what is being recorded. The essential point is that names are recorded in a particular context.  All work done preparing a prosopography should be clearly linked to full, or at least, substantial, transcripts of the sources used.
Hence there are three stages of our prosopography research as it has come to be understood.
First Stage
The first stage is: 
to define the groups or groups to be studied, to determine the sources to be used from as wide a range as possible, and to formulate the questions to be asked.
These issues are inextricably linked: there can be no prosopography that is not firmly rooted in its sources; the nature and type of source available will determine the nature and type of question that can eventually be asked of the assembled data.
This stage demands great care and patience since it underpins the whole prosopography. Decisions will be taken, and carefully recorded, about how to extract the core name data from the sources, and how to represent this and any other desired data in tabular form. This is the 'data-modeling' stage that will determine the structure of stage 2, and make possible the analysis of correlates that occurs in stage 3.
Our research is devoted to prosopographic analysis of the first 18 years of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences. The active phase of the work of the academy began in 1725. From this year the systematization of meetings of the conference began. Conference was the main deliberative body of the academy. 
We have at our disposal a scan copy of all conference protocols from 1725 to 1743, which were published a long time later in St. Petersburg in 1897.
Our previous work consisted of a biographical description of Johannes Jährig, who was one of the employees of the Academy of Sciences of the second half of the 18th century [Dyuldenko, 2017]. Our research was largely based on similar conference protocols, where a timeline of active joint work by I. Jährig and the Academy of Sciences was recorded.
As a result, we have identified and conceptualized the phenomenon of a 'freelance' academician. For the first time, this category was legally enshrined in paragraph 10 of the Academy's regulations of 1747. These people worked under a contract. Its content, the size of the salary and the additions to it were given "to the will and reasoning of the president."
Such contracts, as a rule, were urgent and did not provide the possibility of any increase in rank.

Using the example of I. Jährig, we can conclude that unstable working conditions, relatively low salary, and lack of 'career growth' led to the need to search for additional sources of income, which negatively affected the overall work of the Academy of Sciences.

Taking as a basic concept the intellectual biography of I. Jährig, the features of his non-staff academic status, working conditions, we can theoretically assume that there were similar workers before.
In the regulations of 1724, this category is not clearly spelled out, however, there were already some opportunities for this. There was a poorly defined status of 'young people' who were supposed to help academics in every way and at the same time learn from them.
Thus, our target group is employees of the Academy of Sciences, who made an intellectual contribution to its work, but were not listed as members of the Academy, and did not receive additional scientific and social status.
We can state the problem of working with the target group: we do not have any systemic knowledge about them, each of such people appeared and disappeared from the conference protocols in an unpredictable way. About these people the least amount of biographical data, compared with the official members of the academy.
Our assumption that such people can be 'caught' using quantitative methods, namely by the number of references and the corresponding scientific context in the protocols of the academy. According to our assumption, it is possible to make such a quantitative study using digital humanitarian methods with the subsequent visualization of data.
As a result, we identified our previous research experience, target group and posed the problem and methods.
Thus, our research question is: Who were the freelance academics of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the 20s and 40s of the 18th century and what collective characteristics did they have?
Second Stage
The second stage is a three-part process.
In the first part, a numbered list of all the name forms occurring in the sources is established in an Index of Names.
The second part consists in identifying individuals among the mass of name records, creating an Index of Persons from the Index of Names.
Thirdly, a biographical catalogue or lexicon for the whole group is created by adding biographical data derived from the primary sources to the file of each individual according to a pre-determined 'questionnaire', i.e. a standardized list of categories of information which will subsequently facilitate analysis of the whole corpus, e.g. date/place of birth/death /date of appointments, positions attained, etc. It will not be possible to provide the information in all cases, nor does the process exclude adding any information additional to the questionnaire to the person file. 
The lexicon will ideally offer a natural language summary biography of each person, based on the results of the questionnaire. The data contained in the questionnaire may also be coded in the linked tables of a relational database, which will make them available for multivariate statistical analysis. 
These two stages are painstakingly derived from, and linked to, primary sources. The result is a 'constructed source', or 'metasource'. The same word - prosopography - is used to describe the end-product of the method (the 'metasource') and the method itself. The completed prosopography provides an essential reference work for the study of its period, not least by establishing firm chronological outlines and undertaking a thorough review of primary sources.
Third Stage
Third Stage - Analysis
The accumulated data form the basis for a third stage, i.e. specific analyses of their contents, which look for correlations among the data, for example, relating to social mobility, career structures, nature and function of kinship in political and social institutions, etc.

12.	In the future research can be applied Network Analysis. Network Analysis is a method to study the relations of actors in an academic online network; the resulting network is usually made up of nodes (entities) and edges (relations). Relevant techniques include Named Entity Recognition. When the artifacts themselves (texts, images, etc.) and their relations are concerned, the corresponding research activity would be Relational Analysis.

13.	Visualization of the frequency of appearance in the protocols of actors, the length of the text corresponding to it in the protocol, the subject of the text. Relevant techniques include plotting. 

Conclusion. 
Applying Linked Data principles to cultural heritage data and historical research is a promising approach to solve the problems of isolated and semantically heterogeneous data sources [Leskinen al., 2018]. We assume that the quantitative data obtained will help identify freelance academics for the period 1725-1743. On this basis, interpretation of the results of aggregation detected objects of research will be carried out. 
Interpretation of the results includes:
1.	Modeling the phenomenon of 'freelance' academician. Modeling produces a schema that describes the elements and structure of an object of inquiry in an explicit way.
2.	Theorizing the model of the phenomenon of 'freelance' academician, identifying general principles to explain the corresponding phenomenon. Theorizing is a method which aims to relate a number of elements or ideas into a coherent system based on some general principles and capable of explaining relevant phenomena or observations. Theorizing relies on techniques such as reasoning, abstract thinking, conceptualizing and defining. A theory may be implemented in the form of a model, or a model may give rise to formulating a theory.
3.	For data storage, archiving is provided for archiving in open github repository.
